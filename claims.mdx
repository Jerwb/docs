Our API supports the submission of out-of-network claims to vision insurers. VSP is the only vision payer that supports Assignment of Benefits (AOB), the rest will only pay directly to the patient. Reimbursements typically take 2-4 weeks from the date of submission and will arrive via paper mail. There's no good way for us to retrieve the claim's status. 

We can't guarantee patient eligibility, patient coverage, or payments to you. Confirmation of eligibility and payment will be determined upon receipt of the claim by the vision insurer. Our coverage calculations are usually accurate but are occasionally off. You should let your patients know that their reimbursement may differ slightly from the initial estimate.
