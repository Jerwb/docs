The Anagram API enables you to integrate vision insurance eligibility checks, benefit retreival, claim submissions, and other processes into your healthcare application. It provides RESTful endpoints to interact with various services such as patient eligibility, claims, and integration with the Anagram app.

## Use Cases
The Anagram API supports a range of use cases designed to accommodate various business models and workflows. Whether you're operating entirely online, combining online and in-store experiences, or running a brick-and-mortar location, the API provides flexible integrations for eligibility checks, claims processing, and patient management.

### Pure API (e.g. e-commerce)
In a fully digital environment, the Anagram API streamlines the patient shopping experience by handling eligibility verification, benefits interpretation, and claims submission automatically. Customers can check their eligibility for vision plans while shopping, get real-time estimates of their coverage, and submit claims upon checkout. This approach offers a seamless, hands-off experience for both patients and online retailers, with no human intervention needed.

### Hybrid API and Anagram App
In some cases providers may prefer to send eligibility requests automatically via the API and manage the benefit interpretation and claim submission process in the Anagram App. Anagram's App has a rich plan interpretation and claim submission experience that can make it easier for staff to use.

### Brick-and-mortar using the Anagram App
For cases where staff are in-store and using the Anagram App, the API can facilitate the transfer of data and minimize double entry. Patient data can be transfered directly from the PM system to Anagram's App via the API, not requiring any human intervetion.
