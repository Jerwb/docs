## Welcome

The Anagram API is organized around [**REST**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [**form-encoded**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_\(HTTP\)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms) request bodies, returns [**JSON-encoded**](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

The Anagram API does not have a test mode. The API key you use to [**authenticate**](https://docs.stripe.com/api/authentication) requests is live. You can use the Anagram API with a demo payer for testing purposes, which doesnâ€™t affect live data or interact with real insurance companies.
