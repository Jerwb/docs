## Welcome

The Anagram API is organized around [**REST**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [**form-encoded**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_\(HTTP\)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms) request bodies, returns [**JSON-encoded**](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

The Anagram API does not have a test mode. The API key you use to [**authenticate**](https://docs.stripe.com/api/authentication) requests is live. You can use the Anagram API with a demo payer for testing purposes, which doesn’t affect live data or interact with real insurance companies.

## Testing

There is no testing environment. For testing, use the`insurer:vision:demo`payer in the request parameters. This payer provides mock responses and does not interact with live data.

## Request IDs

The API assigns identifiers to all requests, available in `x-request-id` response header. Our support team may ask for request IDs when handling a case.

## Object IDs

Objects are identified by strings, often called "codes".

```json
{
  ...
  "insurer_code": "insurer:vision:demo",
  ...
}
```

**Note:**

- Diagnosis and services are identified by a list of codes
- For services the API currently requires a single code, specified as a JSON array with a single value

```json
...
"services": [{
  "codes": ["V2020"],
  ...
}]
```

## Types

We use standard types:

- `string` values are generally limited to 255 characters
- `int` an signed integer number limited to 32 bits
- `date` is an ISO string, `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `money`: decimal as a string (not an integer or a float number to avoid round error), up to 4 digits in the fraction part
- `percent`: decimal as s string (not an integer or a float number to avoid round error), up to 4 digits in the fraction part
- Optional fields are denoted as `<type> | null`, can be omitted
- Arrays are denoted with `[]`
