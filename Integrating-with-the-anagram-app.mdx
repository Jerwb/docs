description: "How to use Anagram's API and still leverage the Anagram App"
---

Anagram's app robustly handles all aspects of the eligibility and claim submission flow. In some instances, you may desire to use elements of the Anagram App while leveraging the API to minimize double data entry. Anagram's app has user interfaces for the full cycle of vision plan billing:

1. Eligibility via direct or universal search
2. Displaying all eligibility results and details
3. Flows to match results with the initial eligibility search
4. Benefit interpretation 
   1. Out-of-network benefit calculator
   2. In-network benefit details
5. Out-of-network claim submission
6. View past eligibility checks and claim details

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create Patient">
      You must do this for the patient record to appear in the Anagram App. Initiating an eligibility request by itself does not. Creating a Patient returns a unique code. Save this code to use in the next step. [**<u>Create Patient</u>** resources here.](/api-reference/endpoint/create_patient)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Initiate Eligibility Request using the Patient Eligibility Link">
      Use the `code` from the previous request to initiate an eligibility request using the [**<u>Patient Eligibility Link</u>**](/api-reference/endpoint/patient_eligibility_link) endpoint. 
    </Step>
    <Step title="Fetch Results">
      Acquire the eligibility results using the [**<u>Eligibility Results</u>**](/api-reference/endpoint/eligibility_results) endpoint and submit an [**<u>Eligibility Details Request</u>**](/api-reference/endpoint/eligibility_details_request) for more plan information.
